    <p>How to make homemade tortillas fast and easy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil,
            etc..
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, salt and baking powder in
            a medium-size bowl. Using a sturdy
             ilicone spatuala or a sturdy wooden spoon, 
             mix dry ingredients until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the dry 
            ingredients and add the oil and water.
            Stir well from the bottom up, 
            until all dry ingredients are 
            incorporated and the dough begins to 
            come together and form a shaggy ball.
        </li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured 
            work surface and knead for 1-2 minutes 
            until the dough is nice and smooth. 
        </li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work 
            surface. Divide into 16 equal portions. 
            Turn each piece to coat with flour. Form 
            each piece into a ball and flatten with 
            the palm of your hand. Cover flattened balls 
            of dough with a clean kitchen towel and allow 
            to rest for at least 15 minutes (or as much 
            as 2 hours) before proceeding.
        </li>
        <li>After the rest period, heat a large pan over 
            medium heat. Roll each dough piece into a 
            rough circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter, 
            keep work surface and rolling pin lightly 
            floured. Don't stack uncooked tortillas on 
            top of each other or they will stick together.
        </li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, place one dough circle
             into the pan and allow to cook 45 seconds 
             to 1 minute or until the bottom surface has 
             a few pale brown spots and the uncooked 
             surface is bubbly. If browning too fast, 
             reduce the heat a bit. If it's taking 
             longer than a minute to see a few pale 
             golden brown spots on the underside of 
             tortillas, increase the heat a bit. Flip 
             to other side and cook for 15-20 seconds. 
             The tortillas should be nice and soft but 
             have a few small brown spots on the surface. 
            </li>
